I developed a complete full-stack web project for LegalFutures, a team of international lawyers specializing in asset recovery through official legal procedures.

Website: https://dynamic-kheer-f5af2e.netlify.app

The website includes all key sections required for a legal service:
services overview, asset recovery process, performance statistics, FAQ, contact information, and a client application form.

I was responsible for the entire development cycle, including frontend and backend implementation:
responsive user interface, form logic and submission handling, server-side processing, and overall system structure.

The project highlights LegalFutures’ expertise and credibility while helping potential clients easily submit their cases and start the recovery process.
